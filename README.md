# kubectl-img
At present, only one image command is simply implemented to view the names of different resource objects (deployments / daemonsets / statefulsets / jobs / cronjobs), corresponding container names and image names. Support JSON format output. Finally, use it as a Krew plug-in. You can view the corresponding resources directly according to the namespace.
